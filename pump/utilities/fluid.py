"""
This module provides a representation of fluids and their physical properties, enabling
engineering calculations and dynamic property management.

The `Fluid` class is the central component of this module. It allows users to define
fluids with essential physical properties, such as density, and dynamically add other
properties with unit validation. The module leverages utility functions for handling
unit conversions and context extraction.

Functions
---------
- extract_context: Extracts context from a property key, aiding in unit validation.
- Q_: A utility for creating quantities with units, typically used with the `pint` library.
- quantity_factory: A factory function for converting and validating quantities with units.

Classes
-------
- Fluid: Represents a fluid and its properties.

Notes
-----
This module assumes the use of a unit-handling library (`pint`) to manage and
validate physical quantities and their units. The `quantity_factory` function encapsulates
unit validation logic, making it easier to enforce consistency across fluid properties.

Examples
--------
# Example of creating a Fluid object:
water = Fluid(name="Water", density=Q_(1000, "kg/m**3"), viscosity=Q_(1, "cP"))

# Accessing properties:
print(water.name)           # Output: Water
print(water.density)        # Output: 1000 kg/m**3
print(water.viscosity)      # Output: 1 cP

# Adding additional properties dynamically:
water.thermal_conductivity = Q_(0.6, "W/(m*K)")
print(water.thermal_conductivity)  # Output: 0.6 W/(m*K)

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the fluid.
    density : Q_
        The density of the fluid in standard units (e.g., `Q_(1000, "kg/m**3")`).

    Unit validation is encapsulated within the `quantity_factory` function.
